## Blog-Site
- This is a blog website to be included in my portfolio.
- Website name: My Blog Site

Published: https://fungible123.github.io/Blog-Site/

### Design

- I designed my layout in Figma. 
- Check out the design here: https://www.figma.com/file/bd4OeY1DBF5FfFc6XbtcnmnK/Blog-Site?node-id=13%3A3

### Technologies:

#### Github
 - Used github pages to publish the website

#### Foundation V6.4
 - Used Foundation framework to build the blog site.

#### Foundation Watch
 - Used Foundation watch to compile Sass, run browsersync, and live watch.
 
#### SASS
 - Used SASS to style the website
 
#### jQuery
 - Used jQuery to make the website interactive with animations and effects.

### Remarks:

#### Foundation
 - It was hard to understand at first especially using the foundation mixins but along the way I was able to get a hang of it.

#### Foundation Watch
 - Foundation watch makes my computer slow so I would recommend using gulp to run tasks instead.
 
#### SASS
 - Its pretty much like CSS but you need to know what properties to override if your using a framework and make it work in SASS.
 
#### jQuery
 - Used a combination of Vanilla Javascript and jQuery but its an ease to use plug-ins in jQuery.
